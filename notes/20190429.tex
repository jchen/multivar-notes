\subsection{Pieces of Manifolds With Boundary}

\begin{defn}{Boundary of a subset of a manifold}
	Let $M\subset \R^n$ be a $k$-dimensional manifold, and $X\subset M$ a subset. The \ul{boundary of $X$ in $M$}, written $\partial_M X$, is the set of points $\bm{x}\in M$ such that every neighborhood of $\bm{x}$ contains points of $X$ and points of $M-X$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Smooth point of boundary, smooth boundary}
	***
\end{defn}

Boundary orientation: 

Let $X$ be a piece-with-boundary of manifold $M$.

Let $\partial_M X$ be the boundary of $X$ in $M$ and $p\in\partial_M X$

An orientation of $\perp_p\partial_M X$ is given by an outward-pointing vector at $p$: If $\System{\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_{n-1}}$ is a basis of $\perp_p\partial_M X$, then $\System{\vec{v}_{\mathrm{out}},\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_{n-1}}$ should be a direct basis of $\perp_p\delta M$.
