\exercise{2.10.9}
Does the system of equations
\[x+y+\sin (xy)=a\quad\text{ and }\quad \sin (x^2+y)=2a\]
have a solution for sufficiently small (but nonzero) $a$?

\answer{Yes}

\begin{proof}
  We rewrite the equation to be $F(x,y,a)=\begin{cases}
    x+y+\sin(xy)-a &= 0 \\
    \sin(x^2+y)-2a &= 0
  \end{cases}$
  \[[\bm{DF}(x,y,a)] = \mtrx{1 + y\cos(xy) & 1 + x\cos(xy) & -1 \\ 2x\cos(x^2+y) & \cos(x^2+y) & -2}\]
  \[[\bm{DF}\vec{c}] = \mtrx{\bm{DF}\Point{0 \\ 0 \\ 0}} = \mtrx{1 & 1 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & -2}\]
  $x$ and $y$ are pivotal, so $x$ and $y$ are functions of $a$ in some neighborhood of $\bm{0}$.
\end{proof}

\exercise{2.10.15a}
Show that the mapping
\[\bm{F}\Point{x \\ y}=\Point{e^2+e^y \\ e^2 + e^{-y}}\]
is locally invertible at every point $\Point{x \\ y}\in \R^2$. 
\begin{proof}
	Using the inverse function theorem: 
	\[\mtrx{\bm{DF}\Point{x \\ y}}=\mtrx{e^x & e^y \\ e^x & -e^{-y}}\]
	Then
	\[det\mtrx{\bm{DF}\Point{x \\ y}}=-e^{x-y}-e^{x+y}<0\]
	So $\bm{DF}$ is invertible everywhere, then $F$ is locally invertible everywhere by the inverse function theorem. 
\end{proof}

\section{$\bm{k}$-Manifolds in $\R^n$}
\subsection{Introduction}
Idea: In BC Calculus, the main object of study was ``functions''. This is too restrictive as many objects that are smooth (have a best linear approximation at each point) are not graphs of functions globally; e.g. circle, spiral, etc.

Since the derivative only tells us about the local properties of a set of points, it suffices to ask that the set is the graph of a diffible function in in some nbhd of every point. A point set in $R^n$ that is locally the graph of some $C^1$-function $\R^k\to \R^{n-k}$ is called a $k$-manifold in $\R^n$.

\begin{defn}{Smooth manifold in $\R^n$}
A subset $M\subset \R^n$ is a smooth $k$-dimensional manifold if locally it is the graph of a $C^1$ mapping $\bm{f}$ expressing $n-k$ variables as functions of other $k$ variables.
\end{defn}

There are two important ways to define a manifold:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item By equation (e.g. $x^2 + y^2 -1 = 0$)
  \item By parametrization: $\displaystyle \gamma (t)=\Point{\cos t \\ \sin t}\quad t\in (0,2\pi)$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}
  \textbf{(Showing that a locus is a smooth manifold).} \begin{enumerate}
 \item Let $U\in \R^n$ be open, and let $\bm{F}:U\to \R^{n-k}$ be a $C^1$ mapping. Let $M$ be a subset of $\R^n$ such that
 \begin{equation}
 	M\cap U = \Set{\bm{z}\in U \mid \bm{F}(\bm{z})=\bm{0}}
 \end{equation}
 If $\mtrx{\bm{DF}(\bm{z})}$ is onto for every $\bm{z}\in M\cap U$, then $M\cap U$ is a smooth $k$-dimensional manifold embedded in $\R^n$. If every $\bm{z}\in M$ is in such a $U$, then $M$ is a $k$-dimensional manifold. 
 
 \item Conversely, if $M$ is a smooth $k$-dimensional manifold embedded in $\R^n$, then every point $\bm{z}\in M$ has a neighborhood $U\in \R^n$ such that there exists a $C^1$ mapping $\bm{F}:U\to \R^{n-k}$ with $\mtrx{\bm{DF}(\bm{z})}$ onto and $M \cap U = \Set{\bm{y} \mid \bm{F}(\bm{y}) = \bm{0}}$. 
 \end{enumerate}

\end{theorem}
