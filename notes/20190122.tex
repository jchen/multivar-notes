\begin{theorem}
  \textbf{(Existence of minima and maxima).} Let $C\subset \R^n$ be a compact subset, and let $f : C\rightarrow \R$ be a continuous function. Then there exists a point $\bm{a}\in C$ such that $f(\bm{a})\geq f(\bm{x})$ for all $\bm{x}\in C$, and a point $\bm{b}\in C$ such that $f(\bm{b})\leq f(\bm{x})$ for all $\bm{x}\in C$.
\end{theorem}

  \textit{Detailed in textbook. }

\theorem
{
  \textbf{(Mean value theorem).} If $f : [a,b] \rightarrow \R$ is continuous, and $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists $c\in (a,b)$ such that
  \[f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\]
}

\theorem
{
  \textbf{(Fundamental theorem of algebra).} Let
  \[p(z)=z^k+a_{k-1}z^{k-1}+\cdots + a_0\]

\textbf{\ul{Derivatives}}

\textit{Idea:} Replace a complicated nonlinear equation by a linear one with the understanding that the results only hold approximately in a small neighborhood around a point $p\in \R^n$ but that the error vanishes faster than the distance to $p$.
\[\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)-f'(x)\cdot h}{h}=0\]
For $f : \R^n \rightarrow \R^m$, we are looking for a function $\bm{Df}(\bm{x}_0)\in L(\R^n,\R^m)$ such that
\[\lim_{\vec{h}\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left\{f(\bm{x}+\vec{h})-f(\bm{x})\right\}-\left\{[\bm{Df}(\bm{x}_0)]\vec{h}\right\}}{|\vec{h}|}=0\]
As a linear transformation $\R^n\rightarrow \R^m$, $\bm{Df}(\bm{x}_0)$ has a matrix which is called the Javobian of $f$ at $\bm{x}_0$: $[\bm{Df}(\bm{x}_0)]=[\bm{Jf}(\bm{x}_{0})]$
